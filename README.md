# Reference based Face Super-resolution
Zhi-Song Liu, Wan-Chi Siu and Yui-am Chan

We propose a novel Conditional Variational AutoEncoder model for this Reference based Face Super-Resolution (RefSR-VAE). By using the encoder to map the reference image to the joint latent space, we can then use the decoder to sample the encoder results to super-resolve low-resolution facial images to generate super-resolution images with good visual quality
